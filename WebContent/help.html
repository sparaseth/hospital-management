			Hospital is an acute care hospital, located in the south end of <b>
				Hartford Connecticut.</b> <a>The Hospital came into being in <b>
					1854</b>
		</a> when a catastrophic explosion created the need to treat the many
			injured. In 1994, The Institute of Living, a psychiatric hospital
			founded in 1822, became the Mental Health Division of Hartford
			Hospital.</font>

	<p>
		<font face="verdana, arial, ms sans serif" size="4" color=blue>Today,
			Hartford Hospital is a major tertiary care and community health care
			center, serving a statewide patient population.</font>

	<p>
		<font face="verdana, arial, ms sans serif" size="4" color=blue>The
			hospital has been a recipient of numerous highly prestigious national
			awards, recognizing the institution for its medical excellence, as
			well as its work in the areas of community relations, minority
			recruitment and the provision of health services within a diverse
			population.</font>
